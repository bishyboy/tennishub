This racquet's design is appropriately named SABR, a moniker that epitomizes Federer's attacking style.</br></br>
        Design wise it features a powerful carbon fiber design with Braid FORTYFIVE technology to enhance both dwell time and pocketing while helping the racquet bend in ways that complement the vertical mechanics of the modern spin game.</br></br> Life its predecessor it features foam throughout the frame to deliver a more solid feel, coupled with a reinforced shaft and yoke for more torsional stability..</br></br>

This racquet's design is appropriately named SABR, a moniker that epitomizes Federer's attacking style.</br></br>
        Design wise it features a powerful carbon fiber design with Braid FORTYFIVE technology to enhance both dwell time and pocketing while helping the racquet bend in ways that complement the vertical mechanics of the modern spin game.</br></br> Life its predecessor it features foam throughout the frame to deliver a more solid feel, coupled with a reinforced shaft and yoke for more torsional stability..</br></br>
        Ultimately this racquet design is the culmination of knowledge from one of the greatest legends to have ever played the game and now provides with the opportunity to also enjoy in the experience.</p>

      Head introduces a new and innovative technology known as Auxetic to the Radical MP 2023 to deliver a frame with extra flex.</br></br>
      Compared to the Radical Pro, the MP is a tad lighter and faster, making it easier to whip up spin, scramble on defense or react quickly at net. For 2023 Head improves ball feedback with the addition of a uniquely flexible Auxetic construction to the yoke. This racquet also features Graphene 360+ (called Graphene Inside), which combines the stability and easy power of polarized weighting with SpiralFibers in the lower head for a softer feel.</br></br>
      With the innovative Auxetic technology delivering sensational impact feel and enhanced playability, the upgraded RADICAL MP offers a modern blend of power, control and spin. Engineered for all-court performance players, the versatile RADICAL MP features exclusive technologies, including sound grommets which enhance your power through greater string movement while optimizing sound and vibrations.</br></br>
      The Radical MP is a great option for intermediate to advanced players looking for a versatile player's racquet that keeps big cuts on target.</p></br>

      Introducing the HEAD Graphene 360+ Instinct Team for 2023! </br></br>
      Like the Graphene 360+ Instinct S, this racquet not only offers impressive maneuverability (think ease of use), it also packs a forgiving 690 cm2 head and open 16x19 string pattern (think comfort, power and spin). 
      Other features include a slightly extended length for extra power on groundies and serves.</br></br>
      At 285g this is a verstile racquet that is a great option for both beginners to intermediate level players who seek speed, comfort and power.</br></br>
      As with the other Instinct models, the signature technology is Graphene 360+, which combines the stability and power of Graphene 360 with SpiralFibers in the lower head for a cleaner feel at impact. All in all, this racket not only provides the benefits of generous 690 cm2 head, it also delivers the speed, spin and power for which the Instinct series is known. 
      The fact that it is more arm-friendly than the majority of its competitors is a nice bonus.

      Head launches the Head Boom Pro tennis racquet..</br></br>
      The Boom Pro, the heaviest member of the Boom family! Like the Boom MP, this racket combines surgical targeting with the kind of pocketing and arm-friendly feel that is rare for a modern player’s racket.</br></br>
      On the court the Boom Pro not only delivers the quick handling, easy power and spin-friendly precision of our favorite modern player's rackets, it also does a great job absorbing and redirecting higher levels of pace, making it an obvious choice for experienced players.</p></br></br>
      </br><h2>Racket Technologies:</h2></br>
        <ul>
            <li>Auxetic: The new Auxetic constructions show a unique deformation compared to non-Auxetic constructions. Due to their internal properties, Auxetic constructions widen when a “pull” force is applied and contract when squeezed. The bigger the applied force, the bigger the Auxetic reaction.</li>
            <li>Uni Pattern: The specially designed uniform string pattern allows for a consistent ball trajectory on every shot for reliable and forgiving play.</li> 
            <li>Directional Drilling: Combines increased power and sweetspot, delivering a plush impact feel.</li>
            <li>Graphene: Strategically positioned in most of our racquets, Graphene strengthens the frame, provides greater stability and optimises energy transfer from racquet to ball.</li>
            <li>Morph Beam: The unique frame construction merges an elongated box beam shaft with a powerful head for the perfect blend of feel and ease on court.</li>
            <li>Power Grommets: The enlarged power grommets maximize string movement for increased power.</li>

      Head introduces the Head Radical PRO Graphene 360+.
      Featuring a vibrant and daring new design that illustrates its modernity, the RADICAL PRO supplies the perfect blend of power, control and spin for the versatile, all-court and advanced tournament player. With a new frame for improved playability, this racquet also features the Graphene 360+ technology, a combination of Graphene 360's energy transfer and innovative spiralfibers which delivers enhanced flex and clean impact feel.</br></br>
      Specialising in stability and controllable power, this 11.7 ounce racquet is ideal for strong intermediates and advanced players. In addition to adding 5 grams to the target weight, the 2021 Radical Pro gets a new mold along with a thinner beam and more arm-friendly flex rating. The signature technology is Graphene 360+, which combines the stability and easy power of Graphene 360 with SpiralFibers in the lower head to enhance feel.</br></br>
      Like the previous generation, this stick has a Control Pattern. 
      This feature includes denser main strings in the center for control, along with wider spacing at the margins for a more forgiving feel on off-center impact. On groundstrokes the Radical Pro feels comfortable, solid and surgical. In addition to giving you enough plow-through to trade heavy balls with big hitters, you'll have the control to swing big and execute your most powerful strokes. At net, the Radical Pro has the needed mass to comfortably redirect higher levels of pace, and it has enough touch to drop the ball on a dime. It also shines on service returns where blocks, chips and counter-punches come off without a hitch. With some impressive updates to the beam construction and feel, the Radical Pro continues to be an obvious option for experienced players who want the perfect balance between power and control with a solid feel.</p></br></br>

      NEW for 2022 YONEX launches the YONEX EZONE 98 GENERATION 7.0..!!!</br></br>
      Nicknamed “the easy one”, the latest iteration of the YONEX EZONE 98 makes the players’ favourite frame more accessible than ever before.</br></br>
      The addition of new 2G-Namd SPEED graphite in the throat of the racquet improves energy efficiency on ball contact, generating faster snapback and increased ball speed that’s great for precise passing shots. A thicker, convex shaft reduces torque on off centre hits, offering more stability when you’re on the stretch, while the upgraded Aero Shape frame features a thinner face for a soft, responsive feel.</br></br>
      Combined with YONEX’s proprietary Vibration Dampening Mesh in the handle and shockless grommets, the new material construction reduces unwanted vibrations by 5.9% compared to the previous generation, emphasising the comfort factor that’s made the EZONE so popular with players of all levels.</br></br>
      For this update, Yonex adds 2G NAMD SPEED to the shaft, resulting in a more powerful response with better ball feedback. The racquet features Yonex’s time-tested ISOMETRIC head shape, a unique design feature that makes Yonex racquets feel more generous and forgiving than conventionally shaped equivalents. Ultimately, this racquet’s raw speed and scalpel like targeting make it one of the most accessible player’s racquets on the market. The fact that it feels great at contact makes it hard to beat.</p></br></br>

      Presenting the 3rd generation YONEX VCORE PRO 100 tennis racquet. This is a definite must try racquet for intermediate to advanced tennis players.</br></br>
      Like the heavier 97 310g model this release features design tweaks to the shaft geometry to help the racquet bend more effectively during impact. They’ve also added a slightly thicker beam for extra pop and stability. Under the hood, Yonex adds 2G-NAMD (Flex Force) to the graphite layup. This is designed to help the frame snapback more effectively during impact. Other material updates include Flex Fuse which involves a soft polymer in the layup for added comfort. Yonex's signature technology remains the ISOMETRIC head shape, which creates a larger sweetspot and more forgiving feel. As with the previous generation, this update includes VDM (Vibration Dampening Mesh), a handle technology used to reduce harsh impact vibrations.</br></br>
      On groundstrokes, this racquet is extremely fast and maneuverable helping to generate fantastic racquet head speed. This racquet ticks all the boxes with scalpel like accuracy on slices and valleys. This 3rd generation update to the YONEX VCORE PRO 100 is an amazing frame suited to intermediate to advanced players.</p></br></br>

      Players looking for a mid-sized 95sq inch frame that delivers an all-court, spin-friendly game look no further... NEW for the 2021/22 season Yonex presents the VCORE 95 racquet as used by ATP touring professional Dennis Shapovalov.</br></br>
      This new revision is more focused on spin than ever, with every section of the racket having been adjusted to suit a spin-based game.</br></br>
      The most noticeable addition is that of extra Aero Fins on the side of the frame – small grooves above the throat that encourage air flow in those crucial areas, making the racket more aerodynamic and thus faster through the swing. Continuing the focus on reducing air resistance, there’s also a new Aero Trench along the top of the inside of the hoop, a clever idea that has the effect of sinking the grommets into the frame, making the racket 11% more aerodynamic.</br></br>
      The grommets themselves have also been adjusted, now being straight-hole, rather than angled off, to allow more string movement and increased ball pocketing, further improving spin potential.</br></br>
      Finally, this latest generation has been updated with new 2G-NAMD Flex Force graphite, which maintains greater flex under load for reduced energy loss and rapid snapback.
      If your game’s all about spin, the VCORE is a racket you don’t want to miss.</p></br></br>

      YONEX presents the EZONE DEEP BLUE (GEN 6.0) 100L (285g) tennis racquet.</br></br>
      Like it's predecessor, this racquet takes the lively and spin-friendly precision of the standard EZONE 100 (300g) and puts it into a lighter, faster package.</br></br>
      In addition to being a great option for the intermediate player, this speedy racquet should also help the dedicated beginner rise to the next level. For this generation, Yonex has not only redesigned the beam's cross-section for greater stability and comfort, it has also made the hitting area slightly wider for an even more responsive and luxurious feel.</br></br>
      New technologies include a Liner Tech system, which reduces string on frame friction for extra comfort and power. This technology also features denser string spacing in the center for control, with wider string spacing on the edges for less shock on off-center hits.</br></br>
      To improve frame stability and optimize the flex at impact, Yonex adds a uniquely strong and elastic graphite, called M40X, to the throat.</br></br>
      This racquet also features a Vibration Dampening Mesh in the handle for fewer harsh vibrations and a cleaner feel at impact. Like it's predecessor, this racquet feels comfortable, crisp and accurate off the ground. Although it lacks the stability and plow-through of the heavier EZONE 100, you'll appreciate the raw speed, which makes it easier for you to position the racquet under pressure.</br></br>
      The EZONE 100L (285g) also allows you to execute shots in the run or swing bigger when more pace and spin are needed. At net this racquet's light weight will help you stay active, and you'll find enough power to close out points. Finally, aggressive servers will like how fast this stick explodes through contact. All in all, with some impressive updates to the frame construction and feel, the EZONE 100L (285g) remains an obvious choice for the intermediate player who wants an easy swinging racquet with phenomenal all-around playability.</p></br></br>

      Ex-demo racquet in 9/10 condition. Minor scuff marks on bumper and a couple of superficial paint chips on frame. Pre-strung with a poly/multifilament hybrid string setup.</br></br>
      The Yonex EZONE GAME 98 tennis racquet delivers an impressive combination of speed, spin and controllable power.</br></br>
      With this light racket, Yonex brings the outstanding precision of the heavier EZONE 98 to those who are learning the game and perfecting their mechanics.</br></br>
      At 283 grams strung, it is ideal for the early intermediate player. It should also work for the dedicated beginner who wants a racket that will reward continued improvement.</br></br>
      Boasting more control than the EZONE Feel and Ace rackets, the EZONE Game will give you the confidence to attack that ball with your most powerful strokes. To help with comfort and minimize harsh vibrations, Yonex gives this racket 's handle a Vibration Dampening Mesh. This racket also benefits from an Isometric head shape, which features a wider, more forgiving hitting zone than competing rackets. From the baseline the EZONE Game feels comfortable, crisp and very accurate. Full swings find their mark with ease, and there is more than enough spin-potential to bring the ball down hard.</br></br>
      The light weight not only makes it easy to position the racket under pressure, but it also comes in handy when scrambling on defense or executing shots on the run. The light weight is also an asset at net and on service returns where this racket comes around with lightning speed to deliver very easy shot making. Ultimately, with this racket, Yonex has created an extremely fast and precise weapon for the improving player who wants to rise to the next level. </p></br></br>

      This racquet is a special one time release by Babolat and features specifications closest to Rafa's actual customized pro racquet. Unlike the standard Pure Aero, the Rafa Origin doesn't put any dampening technology between player and ball, giving it the kind of direct ball feedback that advanced players crave.</br></br>
      Additional features include Babolat's iconic Aeromodular beam and Woofer grommet system. This racquet also comes with a firm 69+RA, providing a crisp, powerful and stable response that has attracted generations of players. What defines the Rafa Origin, however, is its 365+ RDC swingweight, making it very challenging to swing but giving it the needed heft to absorb and redirect the highest levels of pace. The high swingweight offers massive plow through power which is perfect for hitting punishing groundstrokes and serves. The flip side is that ripping heavy spin-loaded angles like Rafa takes additional care with both timing and technique. Those who can leverage this racquet's mass will find dangerous levels of pace from the baseline and rock solid stability at net.</br></br>
      In addition to being a great collectible, this is a must buy for those who want to see what it feels like to swing a tour level racquet. Get this rare collectible while supplies last. </p></br></br>

It features a 98-square-inch head and an agile 21/23/21 mm beam.

      Introducing the NEW Babolat Pure Aero 100 gen 7 tennis racquet..</br></br>
      Enhance your game with the new generation Aero 100 gen 7 tennis racquet that delivers fresh graphics and new technologies that help you to reach your full potential on court. Designed for intermediate to advanced players looking for spin, power and consistency, the Babolat Pure Aero is fresh and dynamic. Famously endorsed by Rafael Nadal, it’s one of the most popular and versatile rackets ever made. Boasting spin-friendly precision and raw power that allows aggressive players to force opponents into submission, this racket helps to promote your performance on court.</br></br>
      Compared to previous models, the Babolat Pure Aero features a 100 sq in head that combines with updated FSI Spin technology, delivering a longer contact time between the ball and the string. An effective Woofer System frame-string interaction offers maximum spin with a great feeling, maintaining superior control and comfort with every shot you take.</br></br>
      Its slightly tighter string pattern results in less string movement, and enhances control when maximising stroke speed. AEROMODULAR 3 technology delivers an aerodynamic frame that integrates the bumper and grommets, developing an optimised design that increases racket head speed and generates more spin.</br></br>
      Designed to feel great even on off-centred shots, the Babolat Pure Aero is crafted with NF2 Tech that places flax inserts at strategic locations in the racquet (the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock points on the fame, along with the handle), to create optimal shock absorption and a natural sound quality for an exceptional playing experience. Flax offers vibration dampening up to seven times more efficient than carbon fibre, making this racket the perfect choice for promoting your spin potential while ensuring satisfying comfort with every strike.</br></br> 
      Babolat have done a great job with the design upgrades to enhance both feel and comfort - must try for 2023...  </p></br></br>

      Introducing the Babolat Pure Aero Rafa 2023, the lighter, faster companion to the heavier Rafa Origin pro setup.</br></br>
      If, like Rafa, you are determined to fight for every point, the Pure Aero Rafa 2023 tennis racquet is made for you. At just under 11 ounces (290g) strung, it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa offers excellent ball control due to a fantastic combination of frame technologies integrated into this frame.</br></br>
      Due to its mid level playing weight and aeromodular frame this racquet is wickedly fast through contact ensuring maximum spin manouvreability. Like other Aero frames the racquet plays very stable through impact but this model also offers a user-friendly combination of speed and stability.</br></br>
      In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular Beam and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.</br></br>
      Featuring an amazing paintjob, this racquet was designed with Rafa, for Rafa. This is a must try for players looking to play an agressive all court game </p></br></br>
        <ul>
            <li>SPIN: Nail every shot and keep your opponent running between the four corners of the court. The Pure Aero Rafa offers unparalleled results. Thanks to its impressive stability, this tennis racquet allows you to fully engage with the ball. Featuring the Woofer System, a head-heavy balance, and a more open string pattern than the Pure Aero, this tennis racquet will give you more weight behind the ball to push your opponent back and dominate every rally.</li>
            <li>POWER: Send your rival back behind the baseline and boost your power with the new Pure Aero Rafa tennis racquet. Specially designed with a stiffer frame and a more head-heavy balance, this racquet will help you set the pace on the court with powerful shots.</li>

      NEW for 2020 Babolat adds another chapter to one of the game's most popular player racquets.</br></br>
      As with previous versions of the Pure Drive, this update keeps the same easy learning curve and explosive spec profile that has attracted generations of players. Updated with Babolat's new HTR System, the Pure Drive's graphite layup has been reengineered for higher torsional rigidity, resulting in more efficient energy transfer to the ball. To help with vibration dampening, Babolat has devoted more space in the shaft to SWX Pure Feel, a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the racquet's carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher levels of power and spin.</br></br>
      On court, this racquet's explosive acceleration and spin-friendly targeting make it a dangerous weapon from the baseline. It also packs impressive all-court mobility, making it great for cranking winners on the run or charging into the front court and finishing points at net. Although not the most stable member in the Pure Dive franchise, this update won't disappoint in stock form, especially if you place a premium on quick handling. With incremental tweaks to the feel, the Pure Drive continues to be one of the best options for those who want a light and explosive player's racquet.</p></br></br>
